## NOTE
This is a boilerplate for The Wave projects in React using NextJS. Is crucial that you update all the dependencies before start working on the project.
[This tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) can be used to check and update all the dependencies. When updating a package to a major version (ex: from v1.0 to v2.0), asks a Lead or a member of the team.

TSPATHS might not be working properly so check the `tsconfig.json` file if absolute path are not working as expected.
